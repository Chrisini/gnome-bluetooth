GNOME Bluetooth Subsystem
=========================

The GNOME Bluetooth Subsystem is being developed as a prototype by Edd
Dumbill, with the intention of being submitted to the GNOME desktop
project.

The software is in its early stages right now.

This package contains a Bonobo server to control Bluetooth devices,
and a simple GUI to explore which devices are available
(gnome-bluetooth-admin).  An OBEX server is available,
gnome-obex-server.  This will receive files sent via Bluetooth to your
PC, and save them in your home directory.  The program gnome-obex-send
enables you to send files.  It is used by the Nautilus component -- 
select the files you want to send and choose "Send via Bluetooth..."
from the context menu.

Building
--------

You need:

* Bluetooth libs, utils and sdp installed installed (bluez.sf.net)
  bluez-sdp *must* be version 1.0 or better

* Bluetooth kernel modules installed (either kernel 2.4.22 or get patches
  from bluez.sf.net).

* These GNOME 2 packages:
  	gobject-2.0 libgnomeui-2.0 >= 1.110.0 libbonobo-2.0
	bonobo-activation-2.0 gconf-2.0 gob2
