GNOME Bluetooth
===============

gnome-bluetooth is a fork of bluez-gnome focused on integration with
the GNOME desktop environment.

gnome-bluetooth is the historical name of the first GNOME focused
Bluetooth effort for Linux. As such, when the need came to name
this project, we selected something that was still in the people's
minds.

You can find historical versions of gnome-bluetooth in the GNOME SVN
repository at:
  http://svn.gnome.org/viewvc/gnome-bluetooth/trunk/

gnome-bluetooth does not include the bluez-gnome analyzer, or the
proximity tool.
