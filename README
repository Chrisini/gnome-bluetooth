GNOME Bluetooth Subsystem
=========================

Maintained by Edd Dumbill <edd@usefulinc.com>

The GNOME Bluetooth Subsystem is being developed with the ultimate
intention of being submitted to the GNOME desktop project.

The software is in its early stages right now.  See the NEWS file for
the latest changes in this release.

This package contains a controller class, GnomebtController, to control
Bluetooth devices, and a simple GUI to explore which devices are
available (gnome-bluetooth-manager).  An OBEX server is available,
gnome-obex-server.  This will receive files sent via Bluetooth to your
PC, and save them in your home directory.  The program gnome-obex-send
enables you to send files.  It is used by the Nautilus component --
select the files you want to send and choose "Send via Bluetooth..."
from the context menu.

There is a mailing list discussing this software at
