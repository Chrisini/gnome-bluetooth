Architectural notes
===================

The bonobo component is intended to encapsulate the subsystem: client programs
should use the component.  This enables the system to change while preserving
some guarantee of API compatibility.

Don't hit the gconf prefs directly: the layout of these may change without
warning.  The bonobo IDL is a contract however, and will never change in a
backwards incompatible mannger.
