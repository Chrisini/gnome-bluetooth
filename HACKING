Directory layout
================

src/      : home libgnomebt, which comprises helper classes, and the
            GnomebtController class, the main point of access for the
            GNOME Bluetooth subsystem
python/   : Python tools, including bindings for iconlist from libegg.
obex/     : OBEX send and receive tools
nautilus/ : Context-menu extension for Nautilus
libegg/   : Bits from libegg we need
pixmaps/  : Graphics
ui/       : Glade files and other UI components


Architectural notes
===================

The GnomebtController class is intended to encapsulate the subsystem:
client programs should use this object.  This enables the system to change
while preserving some guarantee of API compatibility.

Don't hit the gconf prefs directly: the layout of these may change without
warning.  The GnomebtController class is a contract however, and will never
change in a backwards incompatible manner within a major version release.
