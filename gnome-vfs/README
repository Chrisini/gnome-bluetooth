gnome-vfs module

I've had all sorts of ups and downs about how this should work. For
the moment, here's what happens: The module fakes .desktop entries for
each device it knows about, which are application links to an admin
tool.  Any files dropped onto the icons are sent to the admin tool as
arguments, and so an OBEX push is attempted.

In an ideal world I'd like much richer behaviour, but this is the best
I can manage within the constraints of what nautilus provides.

(I did do some experiments with the devices done as as link type
.desktop files, but I couldn't get the application semantics working
to my satisfaction.)

If you have a better suggestion (and even better, code), please let me
know.
