Release 0.5.0
=============

 * WARNING: Radical changes!

   The Bonobo component has been completely removed, in favour of a
   normal GObject, GnomebtController, to be found in libgnomebt.  This
   embodies all of the functionality from the Bonobo object, but without
   getting CORBA/Bonobo involved.  It ships with Python bindings, too.

   To find out how to use it, check out gnomebt-controller-test.c in src/
   for C, and the applications in the python/ directory for Python.

   Porting your code to this new object should make your programs smaller
   and more reliable.
