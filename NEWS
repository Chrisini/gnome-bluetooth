gnome-bluetooth 0.5.1
=====================

 * gnome-obex-server: Ask user what to do with received files, displaying
   nice little box with file details.  Also displays proper name of a
   connecting device.

 * libgnomebt: Now includes pkg-config file so libgnomebt can be used by other
   packages.

gnome-bluetooth 0.5.0
=====================

This release provides similar functionality to the 0.4 release, but
with many internal rewrites and cleanups.  New features will come in
the next release, so don't worry!  I'm aware that HIG love is needed
in many places, but as the dialog requirements aren't stable yet, too
much refinement is premature.

 * gnome-obex-send and gnome-obex-server are now based on the new
   OBEX code in libbtctl.  This should lead to an increase in reliability.
   gnome-obex-server now lets you decide whether a device is allowed to
   connect or not.  The download directory can be configured from the
   gconf key /apps/gnome-bluetooth/obex-savedir.

 * gnome-bluetooth-admin has been retired in favour of a new program
   called gnome-bluetooth-manager.  This is implemented in Python, but
   is only at an early stage right now.

 * gnome-vfs support has been removed.  Use gnome-bluetooth-manager to
   view all the devices.

 * OBEX sending support is now available on the Nautilus context menus
   for files.

 * Radical changes in underlying code!

   The Bonobo component has been completely removed, in favour of a
   normal GObject, GnomebtController, to be found in libgnomebt.  This
   embodies all of the functionality from the Bonobo object, but without
   getting CORBA/Bonobo involved.  It ships with Python bindings, too.

   To find out how to use it, check out gnomebt-controller-test.c in src/
   for C, and the applications in the python/ directory for Python.

   Porting your code to this new object should make your programs smaller
   and more reliable.

 * New widgets include GnomebtChooser, GnomebtPermissionDialog, 
   GnomebtSpinner.
