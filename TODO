Todo list
=========

* Make dialogs more HIGgy, especially chooser dialog

* Improve error reporting on OBEX sender

* Make OBEX receiver provide a dialog when a file is received,
  offering option to receive a file or open it with an application.

* Make OBEX sender do a name lookup on the device it receives a 
  connection from: for this, it really ought to have one btctl object
  that lasts its lifetime, rather than creating them as and when.

* Change behaviour of notification icon to reflect Bluetooth status as
  a whole, not just obex transfer.  To wit:
    * Have a "no bluetooth device" icon
    * Have a bluetooth-idle icon
    * Have a bluetooth-data-received icon
    * Have the tooltips explain the current state

* Add a capplet to control behaviour in the large
