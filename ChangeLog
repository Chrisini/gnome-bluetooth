	* python/.cvsignore: upd

2003-11-06  Bastien Nocera  <hadess@hadess.net>

	* python/Makefile.am:
	* src/.cvsignore:
	* src/Makefile.am: install gnome-bluetooth specific files in
	the gnomebt site package, update .cvsignore

2003-11-03  Edd Dumbill <edd@usefulinc.com>

	* python/manager.py: move Python device manager to use async interface,
    show progress of discovery in appbar.
	* src/: Refresh Python bindings for new methods.

2003-11-01  Edd Dumbill <edd@usefulinc.com>

	* src/controller.gob: ripped out the threads stuff
	* src/chooser.gob: changed discovery to use the btctl async method

2003-10-31  Bastien Nocera  <hadess@hadess.net>

	* configure.in:
	* src/Makefile.am: fix build with automake-1.4, and for my machine

2003-10-31  Edd Dumbill <edd@usefulinc.com>

	* src/chooser.gob: started implementing a "Refresh" button to rescan for
	devices.  Currently running into weird threading issues.  Ugh.

2003-10-30  Edd Dumbill <edd@usefulinc.com>

	* src/controller.gob, src/Makefile.am: port Bonobo object functionality
	into a straight GObject, GnomebtController.
	* src/gnomebt-controller-test.c: test program to exercise the
	features of GnomebtController.
	* obex/sender.c, obex/chooser.c, obex/Makefile.am: remove dependency
	on the Bonobo component.
	* gnome-vfs/README: note that stuff in this directory is obsolete
	* src/btadmin.{c,h}: removed these files, they're for an obsolete tool
	* src/manager-client.c: remove obsolete test program for Bonobo object
	* configure.in, src/Makefile.am: definitions for Python gnomebt module
	* src/gnomebt-controller.{override,defs},
	src/gnome-bt-controller-pymodule.c: Python wrapper for gnomebt
	* python/Makefile.am: small tidyups
	* configure.in, Makefile.am: stop compilation of orbit/ subdir
	* python/manager.py: remove Bonobo use, use new gnomebt.controller module
	* README, HACKING, NEWS: freshen up to reflect removal of Bonobo component
	* src/manager.c, src/manager.h, src/manager-impl.c,
	src/GNOME_Bluetooth_Manager.idl, src/GNOME_Bluetooth_Manager.server.in.in,
	src/main.c: remove Bonobo component source.
	* src/chooser.gob: implement device chooser dialog
	* obex/chooser.c: remove old chooser implementation, use new dialog
	* ui/gnome-obex-send.glade: remove chooser dialog
	* src/controller.gob: add threaded discovery
	* src/chooser.gob: implement, but leave commented out, usage of 
	threaded discovery while dialog is shown. To make this usable we need
	to find a way of coping with the fact that inquiries are uncancellable
	and can take up to 10 seconds.

2003-09-27  Bastien Nocera  <hadess@hadess.net>

	* autogen.sh: fix generation of libegg/configure on a clean checkout

2003-09-26  Edd Dumbill <edd@usefulinc.com>

	* configure.in: require libbtctl 0.4 or better
	* src/chooser.gob: start work on a device-chooser widget

2003-09-26  Bastien Nocera  <hadess@hadess.net>

	* orbit/.cvsignore: updated
	* python/Makefile.am: make it install the python-fu
	* python/defs.py: removed autogenerated file
	* python/gnome-bluetooth-manager: added an empty line :)

2003-09-26  Bastien Nocera  <hadess@hadess.net>

	* nautilus/.cvsignore:
	* obex/.cvsignore:
	* python/.cvsignore:
	* src/.cvsignore: spring cleaning

2003-09-26  Bastien Nocera  <hadess@hadess.net>

	* autogen.sh:
	* configure.in:
	* nautilus/Makefile.am:
	* python.m4:
	* python/Makefile.am:
	* src/Makefile.am:
	* src/gconftest.c: (add_device_callback), (device_name_callback),
	(add_device_service_callback), (main):
	* src/manager-impl.c: (add_device_callback),
	(device_name_callback), (add_device_service_callback),
	(btmanager_impl_discover_devices), (btmanager_impl_init),
	(btmanager_impl_connect_rfcomm_port),
	(btmanager_impl_get_rfcomm_port),
	(btmanager_impl_channels_for_service):
	* src/manager.h: fix building with older autotools, fix for updated
	version of libbtctl with BtctlController

2003-09-19  Edd Dumbill <edd@usefulinc.com>

	* nautilus/: add Nautilus context menu component. Initial functionality
	calls gnome-obex-send with selected files.
	* obex/chooser.{c,h}: create device chooser to be called if --dest is
	not specified
	* obex/sender.c: call chooser when no --dest
	* ui/gnome-obex-send.glade: add device chooser dialog to glade description

2003-09-18  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

	* configure.in: require libbtctl 0.3.2 or better, for the
	btctl_scan_for_service() method. 

	* src/manager-impl.c: always re-probe a device when asked for a
	channel corresponding to a service.  This fixes stupid devices like the
	P800 which move around which channels they host services on.

2003-06-07  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

	* obex/sender.c: finished preliminary GUI for
	gnome-obex-send. Still much to do in figuring out how to
	gracefully cancel an operation.  Likewise, the server side needs
	to be able to recover gracefully from crashes.

2003-06-03  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

	* gnome-vfs/bluetooth-method.c: changed linked app to be the
	gnome-obex-send program

	* obex/obex_test_client.c (my_push_client): add copy of
	push_client routine that takes the filename as a parameter rather
	than from stdin.

	* obex/sender.c: main file for gnome-obex-send, a client program
	to send files via OBEX PUSH

	* src/manager-impl.c (add_device_callback): purge service
	descriptions on re-encountering a device, as some devices change
	which channels their services are offered on

2003-04-27  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

	* Make gnome-vfs module display icons depending on the class of
	device.

2003-04-26  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

	* Added a gnome-vfs module, which talks to the bonobo component
	and presents a view of the known bluetooth devices to Nautilus.

2003-04-24  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

	* Release 0.4.

	* src/gnomebt-icons.c: add some handy icon routines to libgnomebt
	to dole out icons to those who ask

	* obex/servonly.c: register with SDP. Add "Quit" menu item.
	Initialise GNOME properly.

	* obex/obexsdp.c, obex/obexsdp.h: added SDP registration for the
	OBEX server

2003-04-05  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

	* Added libgnomebt, which will store useful reusable routines for
	GNOME applications running bluetooth -- UI components, for instance.

	* Added bare bones OBEX server implementation.

2003-02-22  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

	* Release 0.3.
	* Reorganized source distribution so libbtctl is self
	contained. This is because some users want only this component
	without the Bonobo stuff.  Libbtcl will now follow a separate
	development path.

2003-02-07  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

	* Release 0.2.
	* Fully implemented servicesForDevice.
	* Updated to BlueZ SDP 1.0 API.

2002-12-13  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

	* Created user interface: gnome-bluetooth-admin tool comprising
	  src/btadmin.c, src/btadmin.h, ui/btdeview.glade
	* Added CORBA method for finding all the services a device supports:
	  servicesForDevice(out ServiceList list, in string bdaddr)

2002-11-11  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

	* Initial public release.
