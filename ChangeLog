2003-09-19  Edd Dumbill <edd@usefulinc.com>

    * nautilus/: add Nautilus context menu component. Initial functionality
    calls gnome-obex-send with selected files.
    * obex/chooser.{c,h}: create device chooser to be called if --dest is
    not specified
    * obex/sender.c: call chooser when no --dest
    * ui/gnome-obex-send.glade: add device chooser dialog to glade description

2003-09-18  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

    * configure.in: require libbtctl 0.3.2 or better, for the
    btctl_scan_for_service() method. 

    * src/manager-impl.c: always re-probe a device when asked for a
    channel corresponding to a service.  This fixes stupid devices like the
    P800 which move around which channels they host services on.

2003-06-07  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

    * obex/sender.c: finished preliminary GUI for
    gnome-obex-send. Still much to do in figuring out how to
    gracefully cancel an operation.  Likewise, the server side needs
    to be able to recover gracefully from crashes.

2003-06-03  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

    * gnome-vfs/bluetooth-method.c: changed linked app to be the
    gnome-obex-send program

    * obex/obex_test_client.c (my_push_client): add copy of
    push_client routine that takes the filename as a parameter rather
    than from stdin.

    * obex/sender.c: main file for gnome-obex-send, a client program
    to send files via OBEX PUSH

    * src/manager-impl.c (add_device_callback): purge service
    descriptions on re-encountering a device, as some devices change
    which channels their services are offered on

2003-04-27  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

    * Make gnome-vfs module display icons depending on the class of
    device.

2003-04-26  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

    * Added a gnome-vfs module, which talks to the bonobo component
    and presents a view of the known bluetooth devices to Nautilus.

2003-04-24  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

    * Release 0.4.

    * src/gnomebt-icons.c: add some handy icon routines to libgnomebt
    to dole out icons to those who ask

    * obex/servonly.c: register with SDP. Add "Quit" menu item.
    Initialise GNOME properly.

    * obex/obexsdp.c, obex/obexsdp.h: added SDP registration for the
    OBEX server

2003-04-05  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

    * Added libgnomebt, which will store useful reusable routines for
    GNOME applications running bluetooth -- UI components, for instance.

    * Added bare bones OBEX server implementation.

2003-02-22  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

    * Release 0.3.
    * Reorganized source distribution so libbtctl is self
    contained. This is because some users want only this component
    without the Bonobo stuff.  Libbtcl will now follow a separate
    development path.

2003-02-07  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

    * Release 0.2.
    * Fully implemented servicesForDevice.
    * Updated to BlueZ SDP 1.0 API.

2002-12-13  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

    * Created user interface: gnome-bluetooth-admin tool comprising
      src/btadmin.c, src/btadmin.h, ui/btdeview.glade
    * Added CORBA method for finding all the services a device supports:
      servicesForDevice(out ServiceList list, in string bdaddr)

2002-11-11  Edd Dumbill  <edd@usefulinc.com>

    * Initial public release.
